# Challenge

FrostyFriday Inc., your benevolent employer, has an S3 bucket that is filled with .csv data dumps. This data is needed for analysis. Your task is to create an external stage, and load the csv files directly from that stage into a table.

The S3 bucketâ€™s URI is: s3://frostyfridaychallenges/challenge_1/
